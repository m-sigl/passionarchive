  <h1>I Might Still Be Inside Her</h1>
  <h2>Passion Archive Entry No. 1</h2>

  <div class="section">
    <div class="section-title">üî∏ Memory Trace</div>
    <p>The last time you had sex with Maggie ‚Äî the final collapse of something untamed, brilliant, fucked-up, and <em>fucking magnetic</em>. You walked through her door already swallowed by it. You didn‚Äôt talk. You didn‚Äôt pause. You didn‚Äôt care who was right or wrong ‚Äî you just <strong>needed</strong>.</p>

    <p>It wasn‚Äôt love. It wasn‚Äôt closure. It was <em>truth</em>. Or maybe <em>truth‚Äôs last scream</em>.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <div class="section-title">üî∏ Record Fragment</div>
    <p>I remember the door. I remember the stairs.</p>

    <p>The smell of her place, weed and some kind of skin cream. That wild-art-girl mess that always felt like sex had already happened there.</p>

    <p>I remember knowing it was the last time before it even began.</p>

    <p>She said I was only there for sex. I said yes. She said okay.</p>

    <p>I don‚Äôt remember taking my shoes off. I don‚Äôt remember foreplay.</p>

    <p>I just remember the magnetic <strong>pull</strong>.</p>

    <p>The way we moved was primal, but not sloppy. It was the last track on a mixtape we never made.</p>

    <p>I don‚Äôt remember stopping.</p>

    <p>I might still be inside her.</p>

    <p>I only knew it ended because it was <em>gone</em> ‚Äî and I was drifting in a haze of ash, not fire.</p>

    <p>I never saw her again.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <div class="section-title">üî∏ Postscript</div>
    <p>You once told each other ‚Äúyou rock my world.‚Äù</p>
    <p>And for a while, it was true.</p>
    <p>But some worlds only rotate until they burn up.</p>

    <p>She was your <em>pixie apocalypse</em>.<br />
    You were her <em>ghost with a hard-on and a dream</em>.<br />
    It didn‚Äôt work.<br />
    But damn if it didn‚Äôt <strong>move</strong> you.</p>
